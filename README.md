## Approach and Implementation

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialized the project with Next.js and TypeScript for type safety and enhanced development experience.
   - Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

2. **UI Components:**
   - Utilized Shadcn UI and Magic UI for building reusable and responsive components such as buttons, cards, modals, etc.

3. **State Management:**
   - Implemented the Context API to manage global state for the cart and favorites, allowing components to access and modify state as needed.
   - Created `BookingContext` to handle cart operations, booking status, and favorites.

4. **Authentication:**
   - Integrated Firebase Authentication to enable users to log in and log out using their Google accounts.

5. **File-based Routing:**
   - Leveraged Next.js's file-based routing for clean and intuitive navigation across the platform.

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensured that the application is fully responsive across all devices, using a mobile-first approach and responsive UI libraries.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deployed the application to Vercel for easy access and fast performance.

## üìñ Additional Notes

- **Cart Management:** Users can add properties to their cart, adjust the quantity, and view the total price dynamically.
- **Booking Status:** The status of each booking is dynamically updated and displayed to the user.
- **Authentication Flow:** Users can log in or sign up to the page using email and password or google account simply.
- **Favorites:** Properties can be added or removed from the favorites list, which is stored in the global state.
- **Checkout:** After adding properties to the cart, users can proceed to checkout, where they will see the final booking status.

## üéâ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to building a real estate booking platform using modern web technologies. It showcases effective use of state management, responsive design, and user authentication while providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
